This script is derived directly from the script made by Yink for the Enigma Cold War server and available on the [Yink GitHub here.](https://github.com/Yink059/DCS-Scripts/blob/main/recon.lua)

The DCS Tactical Recon Community version tends to add features to the script, useful for virtual squadrons and players wishing to simulate aerial reconnaissance without balancing concerns between sides.

# Original Script Features:

The initial script allows :

- the use of some aircraft as photo reconnaissance platforms (MIG-21, AJS-37, Mirage F1, L-39, C-101).
- the aircraft is detected as a reconnaissance platform if it is completely disarmed, without missiles, bombs or guns.
- the detection of units of the opposing camp according to parameters specific to each aircraft.
- processing of "photos" immediately after the aircraft has landed, with markers appearing on the F10 map indicating the type of unit detected, its position and altitude.

# DCS Tactical Recon Community Script Features:

The DCS Tactical Recon Community version adds the following features:

- the addition of the F-14A and F-5E in the available platforms
- the indication of the life of the unit in % on the marker of the Map F10 in order to simulate the analysis of the state of the target by the photo interpreters.
- the possibility to take a picture of an already detected unit in order to observe the evolution of its health after an attack and the evolution of its position. This feature allows to simulate the possibility to perform a BDA after a strike, a very important mission of photo reconnaissance units.
- the possibility to detect destroyed units (under implementation). This feature also contributes to the possibility of performing a BDA after a strike.
- the possibility to detect static objects like bridges, hangars or various structures from the map or added in the mission editor.
- the possibility for some aircraft to fly armed as it was the case for the F-14 and the Mirage F1 for example. (In progress).
- the addition of additional cameras (panoramic camera, oblique camera, long focal length camera) (under implementation).
- the possibility, for the apparatuses which were capable of it, to make of the photograph of night and if necessary to be able to make it with the simultaneous use of light bomb. (in the course of implementation)
